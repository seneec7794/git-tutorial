#GitHub Tutorial

###Git vs. GitHub
1)_Git_: is a version  control, that can take a photo of you code.

2)_GitHub_: a person could store their code in the cloud, you can visually track changes made (helpfulgit when working with a large group) and work on the same project with other people.

###Initial Setup
*  Initial setup is what you do when you are creating a project, once you initialize you don't lose anything, all of your work will still be there when you close your tab (or workspace)

---

###Repository Setup
* Repository setup is another name for a directory. A repository is basically your workspace where you can put all of your code

---

###Workflow & Commands
####There are two options: 

* The first option is the initial repository (which has no existing projects on github)

* The second option is, you can start your project on someone else's repository: by forking/cloning and pushing/pulling

####Examples of commands:

* git init: this command initializes git on your directory (repository) for version control _*(YOU ONLY DO THIS ONCE AT THE BEGINNING)*_

* git status: this command is optional, it can be used to see which files had been edited since the last commit you made *(this will be RED)*

* git add file.txt: for this command you can add files to the stage to be committed

* git status: again this command is optional but is very helpful, you can see which files are being staged for the commit *(this will be GREEN)*

* git command -m "short/specific message": this command takes a photo or "snapshot" of the files on the stage. The -m mean you should leave message that is short and specific, your message should be in the present tense that would describe the changes made.
